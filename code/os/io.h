// Provides interface for OS specific IO functions

/*
@todo: Let's take a minute to think about what we want here
-[ ] printing & reading to/from stdout, stderr, etc
-[ ] assert messageboxes
-[ ] reading entire files (front to back)
-[ ] writing to files (whole files & with specified offset?)
-[ ] obtaining file properties
-[ ] deleting files
-[ ] renaming files
-[ ] creating directories
-[ ] deleting directories
-[ ] traversing directories
-[ ] looping through directories
-[ ] Pre-defined paths (pointing to codebase, user dir, etc)
-[ ] Could we make a better data structure to handle file paths?
